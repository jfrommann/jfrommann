### Hello traveler, welcome to my GitHub page.

I am a software developer from Hamburg, Germany. For over 20 years now, i have been involved in all kinds of Java related projects. I have seen all kinds of patterns, frameworks and tools come and disappear again. Only the KISS and DRY principles remain...

Currently i am focussing on making the usage of Elasticsearch simpler for developers. Please see [picturesafe-search.io](https://picturesafe-search.io/) for details.
